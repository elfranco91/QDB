				<p>I have been renting cars in portugal on and off for over 12 years, I have had some good experiences and some not so good.
				  The not so good was on the day I was returning to the airport, I noticed some damage to the side of the car, the car had been parked out on the main road and not in the parking area next to the apartment (lesson learned)
				  When I dropped the car back, the company said the damage would cost me <strong>€1,200</strong>, the deposit they had reserved on my credit card.
				  Needless to say it took me a while before I rented again.<br>
				  The last few years, I have been using <a href="https://www.rentalcars.com/" title="Renting a car in Portugal" target="_blank">RentalCars.com</a>, they search for the best deal from a selection of car hire companies, last year I paid <strong> €190 </strong>for 2 weeks in june and <strong>€28 </strong>for 4 days in November, on both occassions it came with a special offer of one extra driver included, which was great as my wife also drives.
				  Both times the company we used through RentalCars.com was called Guerin Cars
				  And I found them very pleasant to deal with and very quick to process on arrival and departure and the price was fantastic in my opnion.
				  I just get the basic insurance which is included in the rental, this doesn’t include excess for damages, Theft, Vandalism, tyes and windscreen etc…<br>
  <br>
				  For all the extra cover I use CarHireExcess.ie, you can get cover just for the dates you are traveling, as I travel a few times a year to portugal I get the annual cover which works out at €48:99
				  I find this way a lot cheaper because, if you get the full cover off the company you rent from in Portugal, it can cost you double or even more then the origanal cost of the car hire.
				  When you are asked upon arrival about the extra full insurance just inform them you have your own and your all set…. </p><br>

				<h2 class="text-center">Portugal's Tourism has grown twice as much as other Europen countries</h2>
				<hr width="60%" color="#CB9231">

				<p class="colorOrange">Date: 7/4/2019</p>
				<p>The World Travel & Tourism Council estimates that growth in Portugal is twice as high as last year and that this growth is expected to grow more than 5%.
The growth rate of the sector in Portugal is one of the highest in Europe and that it, "contributed last year to one euro in five and one in five jobs in the economy.”
 In 2018, tourism grew 8.1% and contributed €38.4 billion to the Portuguese economy, some 19% of the country's economic activity.
The WTTC President, Gloria Guevara, commented that, "Portugal has the potential to further increase the size of its tourism sector by focusing on growth in the business segment, which accounts for only 15% of total travellers' spending against a European average of 21%.
"The latest data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) show that the tourist accommodation sector registered 3 million overnight stays in January 2019, an increase of 4.7% over the same period last year.</p>
